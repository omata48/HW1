## Code Refractor

Given a sample site for a marketing agency that specializes on SEO and brand awareness for clients, we had to look over the code given and edit the HTMl and CSS files provided. Specifically, the HTML file needed:

* Edits to the semantic structure of tags;
* Elements to follow a logical structure;
* Images need to follow accessibility guidelines;
* Heading attributes need to follow a hiearchical nature;
* The title element needs to provide a usefull title

When editing the HTML side of the page, the CSS file needed to be updated to match the replaced elements.

Lastly, after cleaning the HTML, the CSS file could be condensed by grouping selectors that called for the same formating.
